🏎️ Ball Arc — Formula Null Hackathon

2nd Place – Formula Null Hackathon

Ball Arc is a Formula 1–inspired vehicle built from refurbished e-waste. It uses a PS5 controller for wireless input, a Raspberry Pi for processing, and Arduino microcontrollers for real-time motor control. Control logic was developed in C++ to enable responsive driving and system coordination. Despite hardware limitations, the vehicle completed over 10 race laps during the 33-hour build sprint.
